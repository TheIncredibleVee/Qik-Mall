# Qik-Mall: A shopping club system

Designing an easy to use shopping club system. In this project, we aim to design a system to let customers find their destination shops from any location inside the
mall easily. Our software can be used by mall owners to improve their customer experience
and hence it can bring more and more revenue and profits.

Makr Sure to use -std=c++11 as a flag in command line or set it up your IDE's compilers setting in case you face an error of ISO 11 while running the program.
